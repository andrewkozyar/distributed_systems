## Lab 3 Client-Server
# Running
	Download the server.py and client.py python files for Python 3.
	Run Host.py. The server starts and will be prompted to enter the host and port, and then clients can connect. The server also runs on a localhost and can connect to different computers and from other networks.
	Run client.py. If the server is running on the same computer, use localhost as the host. If the server is running on a different computer, but the same local network, use the local IP address of the computer that the server is running on. If the server is running on a different network, use the external IP address of the network that the server is running under.

# Usage Client and Server
	The client should successfully connect to the server. Each time the server accepts a new connection, it will print the connection information to the server console. When the server receives a message from any of the clients, it will print the message to the server console and bounce the messsage to all other clients (not the client that sent it).
	On the client, just type in a message and hit enter to send it to the server. Due to the way the console works, if a message is sent to you while you are typing a message yourself, it will interrupt your typing.
	In order to log out of the server just victorist exit command.
